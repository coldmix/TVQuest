TVQUEST: TV Show guide and information browser

TV Quest allows one to 

1. Surf through a channel and get the shows timings.
2. Find out about Upcoming movies,Sports Shows and many more.

INSTRUCTION: Download the source files from the links above. Make sure that all the TVQuest files are in the same folder and run the python file.

The essential part of the project is the index building.Index of tv shows is built by crawling tvnow.in with results powered by whatsonindia. We go through 7 days worth of page listings The crawled index is stored as a dictionary where

dict[showname] -> [[channel1, [time1, time2, time3, time4...], [channel2, [time1, time2, time3, time4...]... ]], showinfo, showcategory] . The dictionary is saved to file using the pickle module.

The dictionary is later reversed for categorywise search and channelsearching. (We checked robots.txt for tvnow.in and they imposed no restrictions.)

NOTE: *Tv show listings and show details of India only.
